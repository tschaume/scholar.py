We report a comprehensive first\-principles study of the thermodynamics and transport of intrinsic point defects in layered oxide cathode materials LiMO2 \(M= Co, Ni\), using density\-functional theory and the HeydScuseriaErnzerhof screened hybrid functional. We find  ...

>TABLE II. Calculated formation enthalpies at 0 K, in eV per formula unit. Experimental values at 298 K are also included order, as evidenced by the local, rather than cooperative, observed Jahn\-Teller distortion.62 This obviously complicates comparison between calculated and observed bulk properties, including the band gap. Although this issue needs further investigations from both the computational and experimental sides, it does not play a crucial role in our discussion of the energetics of point defects in LiMO2. In fact, it has been observed that the defect formation energy at the Fermi level determined by the charge neutrality condition \(5\) is usually not sensitive to the calculated band gap, as long as the physics near the band edges is well reproduced by the calculations.46,63 B. Chemical potentials and phase stability Figure 3 shows the atomic chemical\-potential diagrams associated with LiMO2. In order to construct these diagrams, we explored and calculated all possible LiMO phases available in the Materials Project database.65 As mentioned in Sec. 2.2, the zero reference state of the oxygen chemical potential O is chosen to be half of the total energy of an isolated O2 molecule. In our calculations, the OO bond in an O2 molecule is 1.21  A, and the calculated binding energy with respect to spin\-polarized O atoms is 5.16 eV, in excellent agreement with the experimental binding energy of 5.12 eV.64 The range of Li, M, and O chemical potential values in which the host materials LiMO2 are thermodynamically stable, i.e., the shaded regions in Fig. 3, are defined by the competing LiMO phases that can be in thermodynamic equilibrium with LiMO2. The calculated formation enthalpies \(at 0 K\) of these phases and those of LiMO2 are listed in

>3Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, Denton TX 4Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry, Duke University, Durham NC, 27708 The quasi\-harmonic Debye approximation has been implemented within the AFLOW and Materials Project frameworks for high\-throughput computational materials science \(Automatic Gibbs Library, AGL\), in order to calculate thermal properties such as the Debye temperature and the thermal conductivity of materials. We demonstrate that the AGL method, which is significantly cheaper computationally compared to the fully ab initio approach, can reliably predict the ordinal ranking of the thermal conductivity for several different classes of semiconductor materials. In particular, a high Pearson \(i.e. linear\) correlation is obtained between the experimental and AGL computed values of the lattice thermal conductivity for a set of 75 compounds including materials with cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral and tetragonal symmetry.
 
>II. THE AUTOMATIC GIBBS LIBRARY \(AGL\) The AGL software library implements the GIBBS method23 in the AFLOW2426 framework \(C\+\+ based framework\) and the Materials Project2729 \(Python implementation\). The library includes automatic error handling and correction to facilitate high\-throughput computation of materials thermal properties. The principal ingredients of the calculation are described in the following
 
> In order to calculate the thermal properties for a particular material with a particular structure, first a set of DFT \(e.g. VASP32\) calculations which only differ by isotropic variations in the unit cell volume are set up and run using the AFLOW or Materials Project framework. The resulting E\(V \) is fitted by a polynomial, to calculate the adiabatic bulk modulus, BS, as a function of volume from Equation \(7\). The BS values are then used to calculate the Debye temperature D for each unit cell volume from Equation \(5\). Next, the vibrational Helmholtz free energy Avib\(D\(V \); T \) as a function of volume, is calculated using Equation \(3\) for a given value of the temperature, T . The zero\-pressure GIBBS free energy as a function of volume is then obtained by This Gibbs free energy is fitted by a polynomial which is minimized with respect to volume to find the equilib\-
