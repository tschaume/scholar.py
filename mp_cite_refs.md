>TABLE II. Calculated formation enthalpies at 0 K, in eV per formula unit. Experimental values at 298 K are also included order, as evidenced by the local, rather than cooperative, observed Jahn\-Teller distortion.62 This obviously complicates comparison between calculated and observed bulk properties, including the band gap. Although this issue needs further investigations from both the computational and experimental sides, it does not play a crucial role in our discussion of the energetics of point defects in LiMO2. In fact, it has been observed that the defect formation energy at the Fermi level determined by the charge neutrality condition \(5\) is usually not sensitive to the calculated band gap, as long as the physics near the band edges is well reproduced by the calculations.46,63 B. Chemical potentials and phase stability Figure 3 shows the atomic chemical\-potential diagrams associated with LiMO2. In order to construct these diagrams, we explored and calculated all possible LiMO phases available in the Materials Project database.65 As mentioned in Sec. 2.2, the zero reference state of the oxygen chemical potential O is chosen to be half of the total energy of an isolated O2 molecule. In our calculations, the OO bond in an O2 molecule is 1.21  A, and the calculated binding energy with respect to spin\-polarized O atoms is 5.16 eV, in excellent agreement with the experimental binding energy of 5.12 eV.64 The range of Li, M, and O chemical potential values in which the host materials LiMO2 are thermodynamically stable, i.e., the shaded regions in Fig. 3, are defined by the competing LiMO phases that can be in thermodynamic equilibrium with LiMO2. The calculated formation enthalpies \(at 0 K\) of these phases and those of LiMO2 are listed in

>3Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, Denton TX 4Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry, Duke University, Durham NC, 27708 The quasi\-harmonic Debye approximation has been implemented within the AFLOW and Materials Project frameworks for high\-throughput computational materials science \(Automatic Gibbs Library, AGL\), in order to calculate thermal properties such as the Debye temperature and the thermal conductivity of materials. We demonstrate that the AGL method, which is significantly cheaper computationally compared to the fully ab initio approach, can reliably predict the ordinal ranking of the thermal conductivity for several different classes of semiconductor materials. In particular, a high Pearson \(i.e. linear\) correlation is obtained between the experimental and AGL computed values of the lattice thermal conductivity for a set of 75 compounds including materials with cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral and tetragonal symmetry.
 
>II. THE AUTOMATIC GIBBS LIBRARY \(AGL\) The AGL software library implements the GIBBS method23 in the AFLOW2426 framework \(C\+\+ based framework\) and the Materials Project2729 \(Python implementation\). The library includes automatic error handling and correction to facilitate high\-throughput computation of materials thermal properties. The principal ingredients of the calculation are described in the following
 
> In order to calculate the thermal properties for a particular material with a particular structure, first a set of DFT \(e.g. VASP32\) calculations which only differ by isotropic variations in the unit cell volume are set up and run using the AFLOW or Materials Project framework. The resulting E\(V \) is fitted by a polynomial, to calculate the adiabatic bulk modulus, BS, as a function of volume from Equation \(7\). The BS values are then used to calculate the Debye temperature D for each unit cell volume from Equation \(5\). Next, the vibrational Helmholtz free energy Avib\(D\(V \); T \) as a function of volume, is calculated using Equation \(3\) for a given value of the temperature, T . The zero\-pressure GIBBS free energy as a function of volume is then obtained by This Gibbs free energy is fitted by a polynomial which is minimized with respect to volume to find the equilib\-

>The accepted model of cosmic silicates is an arrangement of small silicate particles of different sizes \(Henning 2010\). We study three nanoparticles which exhibit the typical bonding and small scale structure of the cement paste. These three models of ultra\-small cosmic particles are selected to represent crystalline and amorphous cosmic silicates, both found in cosmic dust. One cluster, Ca4Si4O14H4 \(labelled as C1 in the following text\), is chosen to model a crystalline state of any possible cosmic cement. This cluster has been modelled on the previous HartreeFock calculation on the formation of cementitious nanoparticles \(Manzano, Ayuela &amp; Dolado 2007\). The structure of C1 has been proposed by Manzano et al as a common precursor of both tobermorite and jennite bulk crystal structures of the calcium\-silicatehydrate. The same C1 structure, but in the narrower spectral region, has been studied using the semi\-empirical MNDO and density functional theory methods \(Bhat &amp; Debnath 2011\). We also study two amorphous nanoparticles, Ca6Si3O13H2 \(C2 in the following text\) and Ca12Si6O26H4 \(labelled as C3\). They have been cut from the bulk of the calcium\-silicate\-hydrate presented in the Materials Project \(Jain et al. 2013\). The clusters are characterized by the CaO:SiO2 ratio of 1 \(in C1\) and 2 \(in C2 and C3\). One \(in C2\) and two \(in C1 and C3\) units of water \(2H and O\) are present.

>conductive properties and where a predictive theory is highly desired. A case that exemplifies the problem is the doping of LiCoO2 with cations such as Mg. The effect of Mg\-doping on the electronic conductivity and longterm capacity retention of layered LiCoO2\-based batteries have been extensively studied.1033 Carewska et al.10 and Tukamoto and West11 showed that doping LiCoO2 with Mg increases its electronic conductivity. This higher conductivity was rationalized by considering the generation of electronic holes due to the formation of a mixed \+3/\+4 valence state in Co.10,11 Later studies17,18,3436 supported this model and suggested that the transfer of an electron from Co ion to O 2p hole is also involved in raising the conductivity. The formation of oxygen vacancies in Mg\-doped LiCoO2 has also been proposed to contribute to the higher conductivity.15,16,30 In addition to the increased conductivity, a significant capacity retention for Mg\-doped LiNiCoO2\-based batteries was independently reported by Chang et al.,37 Cho38 and Kweon et al.39 For example, Cho found 92% capacity retention for LiNi0.74Co0.22Mg0.04O2 after 94 cycles at 1 C rate vs. 70% for LiNi0.74Co0.26O2.38 Mgdoping also improves the thermal stability of Li\-ion batteries. Similar improved capacity and thermal properties were later reported by other authors for LiCoO2\-based batteries.1215,1733 However, doping LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 based cathode materials with Mg cations has the drawback of decreasing the capacity11,13,3739 because Mg reduces the concentration of the active Ni3\+ or Co3\+ ion Several explanations for the stability of Mg\-doped Li\-ion batteries have been proposed. Cho proposed that a lower cation mixing in LiNi0.74Co0.26xMgxO2 than in LiNi0.74Co0.26O2 battery leads to the improved stability.38 A large degree of cation mixing, where Li ions  partially occupy the Ni \(Co\) sites and vise versa, results in lower capacity and affects the structural stability of the layered material.38,40 The higher stability has also been rationalized as a pillaring effect, where Mg located in the oxide layers or inter\-layer spaces prevents the structural collapse and crystallinity loss during charge/discharge. However, it is still unclear if Mg is located in oxide layers or interlayers spaces, i.e. whether Mg is on Li or transition metal sites. It has been proposed that Mg is initially on the transition metal sites, but it migrates to the inter\-layer spaces after initial cycling.22,4143 Xiang et al.44 proposed a similar model based on a detailed analysis of measured change in the volume of LiNi0.80xCo0.20MgxO2 as function of x and possible substitutions and charge balance mechanisms for Mg. They suggested that the stronger Mg\-O bond \(vs. Li\-O\) enhances the stability of LiNi1xCoxO2\-based batteries. On the other hand, Chang et al.37 found that Mg cations are mainly on Ni sites. They argued that Mg stabilizes the NiO2 slab, preventing thermal and cycling decomposition.37 Tatsumi et al.45 also found Mg cations to preferentially replace Ni sites initially, but to diffuse out of the active material during cycling. More recently, Tavakoli et al.46 proposed that a short\-range ordering of Ni cations around Mg results on LiNi0.755Co0.147Al0.045Mg0.053O2 batteries 34.2  9.3 meV more thermodynamically stable than undoped LiNi0.800Co0.155Al0.045O2. Such stabilization can provide stronger bonding and prevent the formation of NiO\-like phase during charge/discharge.46 Despite the significant experimental efforts outlined above, it is still unclear how Mg\-doping improves the stability of LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 based batteries. In part, this is because no theoretical work has been performed to evaluate the thermodynamic profile of Mg in these batteries. Calculations have mainly focused on the electronic properties,18,34,35 lattice stability36 and Li\-intercalation voltage36 of Mg\-doped LiCoO2. Calculations have also been employed to study the site preference of Mg in LiNiO2 by combining theory, x\-ray absorption near\-edge structure and electron energy\-loss near\-edge structure The relative lack of calculations for the thermodynamics of Mg in these cathode materials comes because such calculations of impurities in transition metal\-oxides are rather difficult within the framework of DFT. This is mainly because of DFT errors in transition metaloxides. These errors can be partially removed by introducing an on\-site Hubbard model correction \(DFT\+U\).47 This method has been successfully used to study Liion battery cathodes,45,4851 and other transition metaloxides.5254 It is also the standard approach adopted by the Materials Project54 for high throughput computation of materials, including metal\-oxides. However, physically, the parameter U should depend on the chemical environment of the atomic site where it is applied, while in conventional DFT\+U calculations a universal value of U is used. As a result DFT\+U often fails to correctly
 
>To evaluate Eq. \(1\), we need to determine the atomic chemical potentials i. The quaternary Li\-Co\-Mg\-O phase diagram is available in the Materials Project54,73,74 website.75 From this phase diagram, one can expect separated Li\-Co\-O and MgO phases. Note that these are the known Li\-Co\-Mg\-O phases but additional phases could exist. Based on this phase diagram, we approximate the atomic chemical potentials i assuming that LiCoO2 is stable and in contact with MgO
 
>The enthalpy of formation of LiCoO2 is less sensitive to the U value than CoO and Co3O4. For U values from 3.3 to 5.5 eV, the deviation on the formation enthalpy of LiCoO2 is centered on 0.7 eV. U values in this range are commonly used to study different processes and properties of LiCoO2. U = 2.9 eV was used to study the electronic structure of LiCoO2.80 A U value of 3.3 eV has been used to study the phase diagram and surface properties of LiCoO2.50 This is also the value adopted for Co in the Materials Project.? This value of U was established from a fit to the experimental oxidation energy of CoO and the methodology of Wang et al.52 to correct for the O2 overbinding. U values close to 5.0 eV were used to calculate the average Li\-intercalation potential,48,71 and the defect chemistry51 in LiCoO2. U = 5.5 eV has been used to study the phase diagram and thermal decomposition of LiCoO2.49 U values close to 5.0 eV or 5.5 eV are taken from the self\-consistently determined48 U value of Co in layered LiCoO2 or the average of U values of Co in
